                "description": "With the rapid development of information technology, the field of psychological counseling is actively adapting and integrating new technologies. Online counseling platforms have broken geographical barriers, allowing clients to receive professional help regardless of their location, which is especially important for those with high transportation costs. However, this also brings challenges such as communication security and client data confidentiality. Additionally, mental health applications provide more AI resources with significant auxiliary effects, but their effectiveness and reliability still need further research. AI and big data are transforming mental health assessment and intervention methods, helping to enhance psychological cognition and assist in case management. However, balancing the application of technology with human care to ensure that technology complements professional practice is an important issue for the future."

On the other hand, critics argue, “If everyone is an artist, then no one is truly an artist.”\r\n\r\nRegardless, the relationship between creators and money, production, and consumption has fundamentally changed in the internet age. This talk, from the perspective of a podcast industry advocate, shares observations on how the podcast scene in Taiwan has evolved from a niche hobby to nearing mainstream acceptance. It will delve into insights on audio creators and what it means to be a creator in this era."

It is not easy, but focusing on key periods communications can allow these vastly different cultures to merge into a sustainable and impactful project.\r\n\r\nHowever, this project also revealed the allure and sharpness of the open-source community.

It also has working push notifications using Firebase and is completely open-source, unlike the official client."

                "description": "Copyright defaults to \"All Rights Reserved\" to the rights holders, sometimes triggering criticism of welfare malfunction—Copywrong. Copyleft, on the other hand, serves as a grassroots remedy for Copywrong. It mandates that when distributing or providing software downstream, one must adopt the same licensing approach to provide the source code to subsequent recipients. Initially, Copyleft was limited to the original or directly derived part of the software. However, in recent years, many original Open Source projects, including MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch, have transitioned to be provided under incomplete Open Source Definition-conformant licenses, such as SSPL, CCLC, etc. Sometimes, additional clauses are added to the original Open Source License, such as AGPL-3.0, seemingly imposing further restrictions, leading to numerous compliance and settlement disputes. In severe cases, criticisms and doubts have arisen as to whether such actions constitute Copytroll behavior! This session will use iText and QT as examples to explain the reasonable margins of original Open Source licensing and additional requirements, to assist the audience in facing related matters, enabling them to have a clearer understanding of the core controversies and handling recommendations from the text and historical evolution of Open Source licensing."

This theory presents a classic dilemma: the impossibility of achieving all three qualities simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of Kubernetes, there exists a similar logic to the CAP theorem. It dictates that the infrastructure of Kubernetes can only meet two of the three critical demands at any one time: cost, availability, and performance.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will delve deep into how the principles of the CAP theorem apply within Kubernetes environments, analyzing common challenges faced while managing large clusters and the corresponding solutions. The speaker will share insights gained from hands-on projects, including how to optimize cluster configurations to maximize system performance while balancing cost and availability."

However, this forces users to purchase the software and creates a situation where certain software is required, which poses a major problem in terms of public accessibility. I believe that LibreOffice Technology is a wonderful technology that can directly solve this problem. This time, I would like to consider the benefits and potential of using LibreOffice Technology from the user's perspective."

During this time, the language capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been universally recognized as impressive. However, humans possess another ability that LLMs can hardly match: logical thinking. What would happen if we placed an LLM in a game with simple rules but a complexity of logical thinking far surpassing current evaluation environments? This session will examine ChatGPT’s performance under complex logical conditions through the speaker’s paper presented at LLM@IJCAI’23, and explore the unexpected effects of different prompting techniques. Additionally, we will dive into the experimental code, discussing techniques that can significantly reduce the time required to run an experiment, and share how we extract the final moves made by the LLM from its unstructured natural language output. Through this session, we hope to provide a better understanding of the nature of LLMs and offer useful coding practices for evaluating them."

By combining this with the open-source tool OpenLineage for visualizing internal data lineage, we can further support effective data governance."

This will help accelerate data transformation and improve enterprise productivity. Here are the three unique design features:\r\n\r\n- Semantics Modeling & Indexing: WrenAI uniquely designed a \"Modeling Definition Language\" (MDL), enabling LLMs to understand data structures and internal corporate semantics. This aligns the LLMs more closely with business contexts, providing more accurate question-and-answer interactions for users.\r\n- Augmentation: By leveraging WrenAI's MDL design, LLM's Text-to-SQL capabilities are strengthened, enhancing contextual comprehension and effectively reducing hallucinations.\r\n- Generation: WrenAI's SQL generation process includes a user confirmation flow and post-generation SQL validation and correction, ensuring greater accuracy in SQL generation.\r\n\r\n### Feature Roadmap(only some included)\r\n\r\n- Query Clarification\r\n- User Feedback Loop\r\n- LLM System Performance Evaluation"

Massive numbers of cores, complex caches, and a large number of specialized offload engines have made current models of operating systems irrelevant in many areas, such as embedded, mobile, and high performance computing. New languages and tooling have made writing systems software more productive and less error prone, which has meant that more new ideas can be tried out in both research and development. In this talk I will show how these two trends come together and how they are responsible for the explosion of interest in new ideas in operating systems and systems software.

Chinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK) users need different features than other languages. Language and culture dependent features and usage are important for productivity software such as LibreOffice. This talk will introduce some recent problems encountered in the CJK user environment of LibreOffice and how to improve them. Patterns of CJK language specific problems can be common across different software. Therefore, it may be applicable to other smartphones and desktop apps as well.  The LibreOffice project is an aimed at multilingualism, as stated in The Document Foundation’s “Our Values” of “Our Next Decade Manifesto” that anyone can translate so that everyone can use it in their mother tongue.  https://www.documentfoundation.org/pdf/tdf_manifesto.pdf  However, LibreOffice developers are mostly in Europe, and in order to use them conveniently in other languages, those who understand those languages ​​need to solve the problem. LibreOffice 's CJK and problems unique to the Japanese environment are various such as vertical writing, external characters, phonetic, currency and date notation.  Sometimes CJK regression bugs occur in the LibreOffice project. It is important to strengthen user’s feedback loop approach. We have to be able to explain it to people from different cultures. It is also important that CJK people actually try to fix the CJK bugs.  From COSCUP 2019, I introduced typical LibreOffice's CJK bugs every year. In this talk, I will present some of the major recent issues and episodes in CJK environment. I will also introduce activities in Asian communities and TDF's efforts in non-European languages.\r\n\r\n[Download Slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wKjmous7sZ5AZpWO97lnu90IH8CEC0lg/view?usp=sharing)"

In fact, the European Commission spent around €250m (2018-2020) to shape the development and evolution of the Internet into an Internet of Trust. An Internet that responds to people’s fundamental needs, including trust, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and the norms all citizens enjoy in Europe. Therefore, it would be beneficial to introduce the European OC to the community in Asia. In this talk, the structure of the OC in Europe and how it work would be explained in detail. Some common OC organizations (e.g., Nlnet, OpenWebSearch, NGI, and the Funding Box) would also be introduced. Last but not least, the story of the Open Console Project, the alternative for Google Search Console, and how the project got funded would be shared to the audiences. Hopefully, our story could encourage the cooperation between the European OC community and the Asian OC community."

                "description": "For decades, Europe has been a leader in Open Source (OC) development. In fact, the European Commission spent around €250m (2018-2020) to shape the development and evolution of the Internet into an Internet of Trust. An Internet that responds to people’s fundamental needs, including trust, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and the norms all citizens enjoy in Europe. Therefore, it would be beneficial to introduce the European OC to the community in Asia. In this talk, the structure of the OC in Europe and how it work would be explained in detail. Some common OC organizations (e.g., Nlnet, OpenWebSearch, NGI, and the Funding Box) would also be introduced. Last but not least, the story of the Open Console Project, the alternative for Google Search Console, and how the project got funded would be shared to the audiences. Hopefully, our story could encourage the cooperation between the European OC community and the Asian OC community."

We decided to initiate the analysis of OONI observation data and began regularly publishing Taiwan Observation Reports. As one of the global promotional community partners of OONI, the significance of promoting the OONI network observation tool locally became evident. By analyzing observation data, we were able to adjust our local promotion strategies.\r\n\r\nIn May 2024, we participated in the first in-person OONI Partner Gathering, which invited about 40 partners from 30 countries. During this event, we collaboratively discussed the state of internet censorship in different regions, exchanged insights on tool usage and research findings, and shared experiences concerning how to update and refine testing lists.\r\n\r\nWe aim to share our strategies on participating in international projects, the type of support local teams can offer, and ways to share local achievements with the project team members. Additionally, we will discuss how to engage local community partners in participating in international projects. This session will be presented from the perspective of the Open Culture Foundation, discussing the reactivation of the project, our aspirations to establish a data analysis team in Taiwan, and our potential role in supporting other regional partners with observation data."

This presentation will introduce how we perform Prompt Engineering to develop AI tools for decompiling Move contracts.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are a crucial component of the Sui Ecosystem. However, since most smart contract are closed-source, are written in Move and published in bytecode, non-technical users frequently struggled to understand the function of the smart contracts they intend to use.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, reading existing production smart contracts is a great way to learn how to write smart contract. Nevertheless, Sui’s smart contract are mostly closed sourced and developers found it difficult to understand how it work. This challenge persists even when contracts can be decompiled using tools such as Revela. As a result, developers may find themselves at a loss on how to begin writing their own contracts or how to correctly use existing modules in their projects.\r\n\r\nTo solve the two problems mentioned above, there is a need for a community platform that allows non-technical users and novice developers to easily understand, review, and audit Sui Move smart contracts. This is why we built SuiGPT. With the help of cutting-edge AI technology, any user can easily read and understand smart contracts on the blockchain with the help of the latest Large Language Models."

We'll demonstrate how to use one's OAuth account, like Google, for authentication signatures through zero-knowledge proofs, representing one's blockchain wallet while preventing any third party from accessing the wallet.\r\n\r\n2. We'll explain how to facilitate Sponsored Transactions using multi-signatures, allowing the initiator to interact with smart contracts immediately without needing to prepare transaction fees, while also enabling the sponsor to profit.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing these technologies, we will provide application examples to show how these technologies can be used to create attractive and sustainable blockchain applications on Sui. We will also randomly select six lucky winners who will receive a total of $300 worth of Sui and limited edition NFTs through Zero Knowledge Login and Sponsored Transaction."

Last year, I gave a talk on taking the first steps towards developing extensions[2].  This year, I will present a more advanced lecture. Initially, I will explain how to develop a simple extension, followed by a detailed exploration of my developed extensions that provide features like \"Automatic Query Execution Plan Tuning\" and \"Automatic Hint Clause Generation\" through the extension pg_plan_advsr[3]. I will explain the hooks used, the mechanisms involved, their impacts, and provide demonstrations.

Crossplane empowers teams to create internal platforms tailored to their specific needs by enabling the composition of cloud resources and services into platform APIs. In this talk, we will explore the evolution of Crossplane, the benefits of a control plane approach, and how it streamlines the development of internal developer platforms (IDPs).\r\n\r\nWe will begin by tracing the journey of Crossplane from its inception to its current state as a CNCF Incubating project. The talk will highlight the key milestones and innovations that have shaped Crossplane's development, showcasing its growing maturity and industry adoption.\r\n\r\nNext, we will explore the advantages of embracing the control plane approach for building IDPs. By leveraging the familiar Kubernetes API for infrastructure management, Crossplane enables developers to consume infrastructure resources using the same declarative approach they are accustomed to for application deployment. This consistency simplifies the learning curve and promotes a unified experience across the development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe talk's core will focus on Crossplane internals and how they facilitate the composition of infrastructure and services. We will explore the key concepts, such as providers, managed resources, and compositions, and demonstrate how they create a powerful platform API. Through practical examples, attendees will gain a solid understanding of Crossplane's architecture and its potential for simplifying infrastructure management.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will guide attendees on how to get started with developing their compositions using Crossplane. We will walk through the process of composing resources, creating custom APIs, and integrating them into an IDP. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a clear roadmap for leveraging Crossplane to build robust and scalable internal platforms."

Currently, various AI platforms and solutions are involved in defending and elucidating the legality of utilizing others' materials for AI training in judicial proceedings. This trend persisted into 2024 and even expanded further. Thus, the question arises: does the utilization of pre-existing data or materials from others for AI training necessarily constitute a violation of the law? If so, why are numerous AI generation platforms, which rely on third-party materials for training, emerging so rapidly in recent years? Furthermore, aside from arguing for Fair Use on a case-by-case basis, are there other readily available lawful materials suitable for AI training? For instance, is it permissible to employ works released under Creative Commons Licenses for AI training? This session will utilize explanatory articles and positions from the Creative Commons organization as a reference, analyzing whether the various licensing elements—CC BY, NC, ND, SA—affect and restrict the implementation of generative AI training. Flowcharts will also be provided to assist the audience in comprehending how to make lawful and appropriate considerations when selecting foundational materials for AI training, ensuring that the training outcomes can solidify and grow steadily in subsequent outreach and promotions."

                "description": "“We, the People” In combating digital authoritarianism and allowing civil societies to flourish in an increasingly surveilled and censored Brave New World, it is imperative to focus on the fundamental rights.\r\nWhat we need is a Bill of Rights — an impactful and comprehensive inventory of rights that the people innately possess that is unalienable by the State. This “Digital Bill of Rights,” as we like to call it, is a systematic, fundamental, and preventive initiative against digital authoritarianism and surveillance capitalism. With this Digital Bill of Rights drafted, shared widely nationally and internationally, and ultimately codified domestically and internationally, we begin the critical effort to engineer the legal structure that moves our current state toward a free society and internet for the people, by the people, and of the people.\r\nThe Digital Bill of Rights would serve as an essential foundation for future generations. The people living in the digital age cannot be fully protected by laws written decades ago, as our archaic institutions have yet to catch up to modern-day technological advances. Our once democratic institution is now being undermined by the emergence of authoritarianism, with governments taking advantage of newly-developed technology, pervasive surveillance devices, and now, AI, causing what has been coined as “digital authoritarianism on steroids.” More than ever, we need to list and articulate a new set of freedoms and rights for the people and adopt them immediately.\r\nWe invite you to join this session and think creatively and boldly! We will begin with a template Bill the Judicial Reform Foundation has been creating with a diverse group of digital rights lawyers. Tell us what you think of the rights enshrined. Even better, share new ideas and innovative forms of rights that you believe the people should have to protect themselves from surveillance capitalism and digital authoritarianism. This is a safe and fun place for ideas, for imaginations, and for solidarity.\r\nThe goal of this session is to (1) expand the Digital Bill of Rights’ applicability for a variety of demographics, cultural origin, and professional standing-points; (2) that session is not a one-off event but a beginning of a global movement where mutual trust and bottom-up collaboration are deeply baked in from the very beginning.\r\nFreedom begins by knowing another world is possible. Let's begin the exciting project in building the fundamental frameworks of a free digitized society. Join us, will you?\r\n\r\nTargeted Audiences: \r\n-People looking for original ideas -- and those who have them!\r\n-People who not only have been responding to digital harms but also find it important to actively build better paradigms for digital freedom.\r\n-People passionate in the creative effort in articulating what freedom means and what it takes in the digitized generation. Let's work it out, together!"

It checks whether each interaction complies with the specified security policies, and if it does not, it denies such interaction. Even if one of the components is hacked, Kaspersky Security System will reduce or minimize possible damage. There is open source version - KasperskyOS Community Edition (CE) that can help to create security applications on Raspberry Pi 4. We will also present the Secure Login example through KasperskyOS CE that demonstrates the use of the Information Obscurity security pattern.

These guides are compiled by various government agencies, private organizations, healthcare institutions, and communities, providing standardized guidelines for the implementation of FHIR standards across different systems and environments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, international IG Registries are already in place. Following the adoption of FHIR standards in Taiwan, the government launched the TW Core Implementation Guide (IG) Management Platform in 2022 under the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Electronic Medical Records Promotion Zone. However, the review mechanism of this Registry is relatively stringent. As FHIR continues to be promoted in Taiwan, more organizations are developing IGs and attempting cross-institutional exchanges. Due to these reasons, we have established the TW Open Registry platform, providing an accessible platform for locating IGs and achieving the goal of promoting healthcare information interoperability.\r\n\r\nThis session will introduce the structure, composition, community operation mechanisms, and processes of the Taiwan FHIR Open Registry, and compare it with the government Registry. It will demonstrate how developers can quickly obtain the desired Implementation Guides through the IG Registry. Additionally, by integrating with MI-TW interoperability events, the Taiwan FHIR Open Registry will achieve more in-depth practical applications."

To address this, we have developed an innovative open-source digital pathology image display platform called Mainecoon. This platform integrates the DICOM standard and supports Whole Slide Images (WSI) from different scanner brands.

NeuVector will run the customized shell scripts with GoLang, culminating the result into a detailed UI report.\r\n\r\nDuring deployment on Bottlerocket environments, NeuVector encountered unexpected shell command issues. Various attempted fixes, including adding path variables to cover command paths and linking the C runtime using ldd, proved ineffective. It transpired that the built-in C runtime differed from that of Bottlerocket, leading to symbolic link discrepancies and subsequent failures. Initially perceived as minor, these issues unveiled significant systemic challenges within the existing CIS benchmark workflow. This experience prompted a thorough investigation into underlying problems, resulting in valuable workflow enhancements.\r\n\r\nThis presentation not only elucidates the analytical process and resulting resolutions but also delves into ongoing development and optimization efforts."

My father is a professional in the fields of telecommunications engineering and electronics, and his work has sparked my curiosity about the workings of electronic devices. As a result, I ventured into the field of programming. Since childhood, I have aspired to become a software engineer, a dream that has never wavered. The elders have long foreseen the future of information engineering and provided their support. I aspire to integrate this passion for technology and my vision for the future into my career, contributing professional skills and enthusiasm. Having completed 12 years of comprehensive education, I have developed balanced skills and rich experiences in morality, intelligence, physical fitness, group activities, and aesthetics, enabling me to face various challenges.\r\n\r\nTechnical Education Laying the Foundation\r\n\r\nUpon entering university, I was admitted through technical excellence admission and chose the Department of Intellgent Production Engineering at National Taichung University of Science and Technology. This interdisciplinary program combines various fields such as information engineering, artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing, and statistics, allowing me to apply my expertise to a wide range of projects and become a well-rounded individual. During my university years, I became involved in the open-source community and had the opportunity to participate in various information seminars. I even presented at COSCUP Lightning Talks, benefiting greatly from community exchanges. These learning experiences not only enrich my life but also accumulate diverse experiences for my future career. Additionally, to enhance my competitiveness, I actively participated in various competitions, demonstrating my abilities in software development and computer applications.\r\n\r\nApplying Knowledge to Practice, Accumulating Practical Experience\r\n\r\nOutside of my studies, I cherish my spare time and actively engage in practical work. A mentor once advised me, \"Even when working during the school term, choose jobs that require strong expertise, not just tasks that everyone can easily handle.\" Following this advice, I became a teaching assistant for the Kaohsiung Information Education Association's C++ camp during high school. During my university years, I participated in National Science Council projects and served as a lecturer at the Yuan Chuang Li Programming School, accumulating multiple experiences in online and offline programming teaching. These experiences prove that I not only meet industry standards but also give me confidence to face future challenges.\r\n\r\nPassion and Ability Combined, Pursuing Excellence\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I am immersed in researching various topics related to machinery and computer hardware and software. My passion combined with my expertise allows me to progress smoothly at every stage and to boldly try new things. When others seek my help, I am happy to provide thoughtful support and advice. For me, facing challenges is an opportunity for growth. I overcome difficulties with focus and perseverance. This positive attitude enables me to adapt flexibly to various situations and demonstrate efficiency and problem-solving skills in my work. I aim to become an engineer with solid professional knowledge, continuously devoting myself to the field of software development and bringing new value and achievements through innovation and contributions. I firmly believe in my ability to continue learning and solving problems and look forward to shining in the field of software development, becoming a versatile software engineer."

In this session, I  propose HTAP configurations that also handle OLAP efficiently using OSS PostgreSQL and its extensions.

Langchain is a project focused on natural language processing, while RAG is a powerful method for generative dialogue systems with retrieval-augmented features. The combination of these two technologies provides new ideas and tools for developing natural language processing applications.\r\n\r\nNext, we will introduce Streamlit, a popular open-source framework that helps developers easily build interactive web applications. We will discuss how to integrate Langchain and RAG into Streamlit and demonstrate how this integration improves development efficiency and application performance.\r\n\r\nThen, we will share the challenges and issues encountered when applying theory to practice, as well as the valuable lessons learned from these experiences. These insights will help the audience better understand how to develop artificial intelligence applications using Langchain and RAG on Streamlit while avoiding common mistakes and difficulties.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will look ahead to the future development of Langchain, RAG, and Streamlit, and discuss possible application scenarios and improvement directions. This will provide the audience with an in-depth understanding of the prospects and trends of artificial intelligence technology."

Subsequently, I delved into the source code of Z80-MBC2 to grasp its uploading principle. For executing this project, I opted to use Arduino Uno as the loader core.\r\n\r\nAfter familiarizing myself with the pinout of Arduino Uno, I discovered that A0 to A5, D6, and D7 belong to the same register and can serve as the data bus. Then, I delved into Uno's PWM output pins and ultimately decided to use D3 as the clock output for Z80.\r\n\r\nReferring to the book \"Z80 Microcomputer Construction,\" I learned about the main chips including Z80, SRAM, and 8255, with the latter responsible for I/O. Initially, I installed an LED on the PC7 pin of 8255 and successfully conducted experiments.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I spent several days transcribing the supervisor program from the book, conducting text recognition, and making necessary corrections to prepare it for uploading to the Z80 system. Despite encountering some errors during text recognition, I eventually succeeded in getting the supervisor program to function properly."
